The purpose of this is to be able to temporarily increase Abilities and Talents, and add temporary powers.

Add a button under EDGE on the character sheet. The button should read 'Temporary Buffs'

Clicking 'Temporary Buffs' changes the character sheet so that any changes to Abilities and Talents are not persisted. Any Powers added to the sheet in this mode will have the temporary boolean set to true.

Values entered in this mode that are different from baseline Abilities and Talents will create an Active Effect to implement that new value.

While in 'Temporary Buffs' mode, the button text changes to 'Return to Normal'. Clicking this returns the sheet to its normal functioning. Delete all Active Effects and temporary powers on the character.

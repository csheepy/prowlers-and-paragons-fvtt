# Prowlers and Paragons system

This is an unofficial Foundry VTT system for running games in [Prowlers and Paragons](https://mobiusworldspublishing.com/products/prowlers-paragons-ultimate-edition/).

## Features

Right click dice results in chat for reroll / explosions

Automatic opposed rolls are triggered if you roll with a target selected.

Powers like Density can be set to Toggleable and they'll turn on and off any associated Active Effects you add (like might and toughness upgrades)

A temporary buffs mode for the sheet to make short-term flexible powers increasing Abilities/Talents easier
